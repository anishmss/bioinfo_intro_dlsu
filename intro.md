## Course Description
Modern biology relies on a host of experimental techniques which shed light into a variety of phenomena that come together to constitute this amazing thing we call "life". 
These experiments generate massive amounts of data, most of which are in the form of sequences.
Making sense of these sequences requires, apart from a keen understanding of biology, the ability to employ a range of tools from the arsenal of computer science, mathematics, and statistics.
In this course, we will explore the basic computational techniques required for biological sequence analysis.

## Target Audience
This is an introductory course in bioinformatics offered periodically as an elective course to higher undergraduates or early graduate computer science students at DLSU-Manila. 

The material is targeted towards students from a computational discipline who have taken foundational courses in algorithms or programming, or probability and statistics, etc, and who have interest in biology.



## Learning outcomes
At the end of the course, the student is expected to be able to do the following:

- Describe basic biological processes and how these can be studied using computational tools.
- Search publicly available databases for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic data.
- Choose from the many sequence analysis algorithms and software tools and apply them to publicly available biological data to answer questions about sequence evolution.



## Learning Plan
This course runs for 13 weeks. 
Weeks 1 -- 4 will be devoted to some of the essential concepts of molecular biology.
We will discuss computational techniques starting Week 5.
These will be in the form of case studies.

## Reference Material

A comprehensive textbook for bioinformatics perhaps does not exist.
It's hard to write one because the field is moving rapidly and students have varying backgrounds.

This online ''book'' contains notes for each module. 
It is meant to provide structure to the course and not meant to be comprehensive.
Please read reference materials provided at the end of each module. 


Nonetheless, here are some good books to learn the foundational concepts in bioinformatics and biology.
