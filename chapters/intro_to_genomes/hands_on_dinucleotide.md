# Genome sequence compositional frequency

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to compare the nucleotide and di-nucleotide frequencies in the human and fruit fly genomes, and to discuss possible biological justifications for the observations.

Your genome sequence can be represented by a string over the alphabet {a,c,g,t}. Are the frequencies of a,c,g,t uniform? How about di-nucleotides, are their frequencies uniform? 

Report on the following about Chromosome 10 of the human genome.

 - How many nucleotides are in this chromosome?

 - TODO: something about most popular genes

## Method

Perform the following for human and fruit-fly genome.

Step 1: Let $S$ be a DNA string of length 50 kilo-bases, taken from a random position in the genome. 

Step 2: Observe the frequencies of the 16 possible dinucleotides.

Step 3: Compute the over-representation or under-representation of the dinucleotides by computing the odds ratio of observed and expected frequencies.

Step 4: Repeat 100 times, to get average values.

Step 5: Visualize and discuss your results.
