# Genome annotation

## A sea of a,c,g,t s
Say you sequenced the genome of your favorite organism and assembled the short DNA fragments into longer genome sequence. The blueprint is less of a blue-print but more of a vase blue sea of a,c,g, and ts.
What lies ahead is the challenge of **genome annotation**, which means to locate the genes and other interesting elements in the genome sequence. We saw saw of them being 

Genome annotation cannot be done by eye, even for smaller genomes like those of bacteria or even smaller ones of viruses. And so the last decade or two has seen a lot of development in algorithms and tools. 
These have helped unravel the amazing complexity and intricacies of our genomes, and those of multitude of species around us. 

## The annotation problem
Let's formalize the problem a bit. 

## The approaches

### By comparing against already annotated sequences

### Using hidden Markov models
